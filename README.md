# News Site

A news site about pickles.

The project was to build a website containing header, navigation, big-news section and small-news section using flex box and css grid.

## The problem

I started coding the site from desktop first approach and realised the problems that came with it.
To tackle the problem I started re-code from the mobile view and kept the previous code in media queries.
In my project I used flexbox and css grid.
If I had to do the project again I would always start from mobile-first approach.
